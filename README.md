# Project Nexus: Job Portal For Recruiters and Talents

## Overview

Welcome to the **Job Portal Backend**! This project is a comprehensive backend system for a job board platform, but with a unique focus on empowering users' careers. Going beyond simple job listings, this platform acts as a career-building tool, featuring personalized recommendations, skill-matching, and professional networking functionalities. It serves as the capstone for the ProDev Backend Engineering program, demonstrating mastery of modern backend technologies and best practices.

## Core Features

* **User Authentication & Profiles:** Robust user registration, login, and profile management for both job seekers and companies.
* **Job Listings:** Users can create, view, and apply for job postings.
* **Skill-Matching Algorithm:** An advanced feature that analyzes a job seeker's profile and resume to provide a compatibility score for relevant jobs.
* **Personalized Recommendations:** The system suggests jobs and learning resources based on a user's skills, interests, and past interactions.
* **Professional Networking:** A built-in messaging system for job seekers to connect directly with recruiters and hiring managers.

## Technical Architecture

This project is built on a modern, scalable backend stack. The architecture is designed for efficiency, performance, and maintainability.

### Major Learnings & Technologies

| Category | Key Technologies & Concepts |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Backend Development** | **Python:** The core programming language for the entire application. <br> **Django & Django REST Framework:** Used to build the application's logic and RESTful API endpoints. <br> **Hybrid API (REST & GraphQL):** A primary focus on building robust RESTful endpoints while exploring a GraphQL API for efficient data fetching to avoid over- and under-fetching. |
| **Databases & Caching** | **PostgreSQL:** A powerful and reliable relational database. The schema is optimized with proper indexing and normalization for efficient queries. <br> **Redis:** Used for caching frequently accessed data and for managing session data, which significantly improves application performance. |
| **Asynchronous & Background Tasks** | **Celery & RabbitMQ:** Implemented to handle time-consuming background tasks like running the skill-matching algorithm, sending email notifications, and processing user data without blocking the main application thread. |
| **DevOps & Deployment** | **Docker:** The entire application stack (Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ) is containerized using Docker Compose, ensuring a consistent and isolated development and production environment. <br> **CI/CD with GitHub Actions:** An automated pipeline for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. This workflow automatically runs tests and deploys the application on every code push, ensuring code quality and a streamlined release process. |

<!-- ### Challenges Faced & Solutions Implemented

* **Challenge:** Implementing a live-updating feature for the professional networking part of the application.
* **Solution:** Explored and implemented **Django Channels** to enable WebSocket communication, providing real-time messaging capabilities for direct communication between users.

* **Challenge:** The skill-matching algorithm was initially slow, causing delays for the user.
* **Solution:** Rearchitected the process to use a **Celery task**. The user's request now triggers an asynchronous task that runs the algorithm in the background, and the user is notified when the results are ready, ensuring a smooth user experience.

* **Challenge:** Managing a complex project with multiple interconnected services.
* **Solution:** Used **Docker Compose** for local development, which allowed for a seamless setup of all services. **Trello** was also used to organize project milestones and tasks, ensuring an organized and methodical approach. -->

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/chinazagideon/alx-project-nexus.git](https://github.com/chinazagideon/alx-project-nexus.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Set up the environment:**
    Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit the .env file with your specific configurations
    ```
3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This will build the Docker images, run the containers, and set up the database.

## API Documentation

The API endpoints are fully documented using **Swagger/OpenAPI**. You can access the interactive documentation at `http://localhost:8000/api/docs/` after running the application.

## Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

* **Focus on Code Quality:** Prioritized writing **clean, modular, and well-documented code**. Adhering to PEP 8 standards and using meaningful variable names made the code easier to read and maintain.
* **Version Control:** Leveraged Git and GitHub for proper version control and to manage development branches, which was critical for tracking changes and ensuring a smooth workflow.
* **The Power of Automation:** Implementing a CI/CD pipeline was a game-changer. It taught me the importance of automating tests and deployment, which are essential practices in professional software development.
* **Problem-Solving:** The project reinforced the importance of breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks. It taught me to think critically about system design and to make informed decisions about technology choices.
